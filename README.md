# Next.js 15 App Router Middleware Bug

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using middleware with dynamic routes.  Middleware does not function correctly under certain conditions involving dynamic route segments.

## Bug Description

The middleware is expected to run before rendering the page, applying transformations or redirects as needed. However, in the scenario presented in `index.js`, the middleware fails to execute for a specific type of dynamic route.  This could be due to how Next.js handles dynamic routing within the App Router when applying Middleware.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to a route that triggers the issue described above (see the `index.js` file for details).

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should execute and perform the expected action (e.g., redirect, modify request headers) before the page component is rendered. 

## Actual Behavior

The middleware does not run for the problematic dynamic segment. The page renders without the middleware's effects applied.

## Solution

The provided `index.js` file has a fix. The issue is solved by carefully reviewing and modifying the dynamic route configuration. The implementation ensures that the middleware correctly matches and handles all dynamic route segments, resolving the unexpected behavior.
